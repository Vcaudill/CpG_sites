1. Run Connetct.R 
   R_scripts > DataForamtting > Connect.R

   *This will create frequency tables for each virus/gene in output/Csv in a csv format 

2. Run MakeWilcoxTables.R & M_frequency_graph.R with Wilcox_Tables_M_Freq_Graphs_other.R
   1) R_scripts > graphs > Wilcox_Tables_M_Freq_Graphs_other.R

   *This will create Wilcox tables & Frequency figure for each virus/gene in output/ancestor/WilcoxTables & output/ancestor/M_frequency_graphs or output/consensus/WilcoxTables & output/consensus/M_frequency_graphs as a png files

3. Create Costly Figure
   1) R_scripts > graphs > Costly_Graph.R

   *This will create the costly figure output/ancestor/Costly or output/consensus/Costly
   * It will also create a csv file called alldatapoints which 

4. Data Summary Figure
   1)  R_scripts > graphs > data_summary.R

   *This will create a data summary figure in output/ancestor or output/consensus it also calculates the percentages that were significant
